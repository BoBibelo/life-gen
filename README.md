Game of life with 'map editor'
You can choose the map size, the initial cells position, and the number of
generations to do (or set to 1 and click on evolve to see a step by step).

It has been done very quickly in an hour, therefore you'll find bugs.
It was just a fun project for me to discover more about the
[Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).
